### Features
- Users can add and remove liquidity to the exchange by contributing tokens to the pool.
- The DEX uses an AMM mechanism to facilitate token swaps without relying on order books.
- Users can swap tokens using the liquidity pool, with the price determined algorithmically based on the poolâ€™s current balances.
- The platform implements a 3% fee on each token swap, which is deducted from the output token and retained by the liquidity pool.
- Liquidity providers earn a share of the total liquidity based on their contributions and can withdraw it at any time.
